# Getting Started

After you install the CloudBoz CLI, run the `cloudboz login` command. You’ll be prompted to enter any key to go to your web browser to complete login. The CLI will then log you in automatically.

```
cloudboz login
cloudboz: Enter your login credentials
Email: guest@cloudboz.com
Password: ***************
Logged in as guest@cloudboz.com
```

The CLI saves your email address and an API token to `~/.cloudboz/config` for future use.

Now you’re ready to create your first apps!
